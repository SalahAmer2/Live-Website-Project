      <p style=" color: white">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans,
      which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.The genus Coffea is native to
      tropical Africa and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.</p>

      <p id="panel">Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the
         equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian
         subcontinent, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are C. arabica
         and C. robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and
         dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to
         varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are
         ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage
         known as coffee.</p>
